# Cost-Efficient Thermal Regulation System for Poultry Farms

## Overview
An intelligent poultry farm temperature control system using ESP32 and Machine Learning to reduce heat stress and improve productivity.

## Problem Statement
Unstable temperatures in poultry cages lead to heat stress, reduced growth, and economic loss.

## Objectives
- Maintain optimal cage temperature
- Reduce manual intervention
- Improve poultry health and productivity

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 (IoT)
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- Random Forest Algorithm (R)
- Arduino IDE / MicroPython

## System Architecture
IoT-based real-time monitoring combined with ML-based temperature prediction.

## Machine Learning Integration
Random Forest model predicts temperature for the next 10 days using historical data.

## Expected Output
- Automatic fan control
- Stable cage temperature
- Reduced heat stress

## Applications
- Poultry farms
- Smart agriculture
- Environmental monitoring
